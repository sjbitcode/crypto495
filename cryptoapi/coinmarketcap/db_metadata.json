        "description": "Dash (DASH), formerly known as Darkcoin until March 26th, 2015, is a privacy-centric digital currency with instant transactions. Similar to cash, Dash allows you to remain anonymous while transacting. Dash protects privacy by anonymizing transactions that are made over the network using a technology developed by the Dash team called DarkSend. DarkSend is inspired by the CoinJoin project that was birthed to anonymize Bitcoin transactions.\n\nUsing Dash, payments are private and cannot be tracked along with balances. Dash harnesses the power of its Masternode network to power an innovative technology called InstantX. When sending funds, users can use InstantX and transactions will be fully sent and irreversible within four seconds. \n\nDash was released on the 18th January 2014 with zero premine coins. It uses 11 rounds of hashing algorithm namely blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, and echo. As of the current design, there will only be 22 million Dash ever created, making it a deflationary currency.",

When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow for code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. The Ethereum network went live on July 30th, 2015 with 72 million Ethereum premined.",

Third-party developers will also be able to introduce their own services. \n\nA prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events, Individuals will be able to create prediction markets for events, allowing users to buy shares of predicted events. \n\nThe platform employs a dual token structure: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are ERC-20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. OWL tokens are earned by staking GNO. The amount of OWL received is dependent on the length of the lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. \n\nThe team is led by Martin K\u00f6ppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO).",

The network is composed of the aggregated power of user devices. Golem is reportedly able to compute tasks that run the gamut from CGI rendering to machine learning.

It also claims to supports cross-chain interoperability, which could allow blockchains built with Komodo to connect with external chains via atomic swaps. Additional chains can reportedly be added to form a blockchain cluster to enhance performance without debasing the currency. Komodo is also reportedly secured with the hashing power of the Bitcoin network via a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes.",

It also powers real applications via social apps like Steemit. \n\nSteem started out as the cryptocurrency on the Steemit platform that rewards users for community building through the upvoting and the posting of meaningful content. Founded in 2016 by Ned Scott and BitShares creator Dan Larimer, the Steemit platform, built atop the Steem blockchain, is a social media network that seeks to be a source of community-driven curated content such as news, Q&A and job boards. The more value a particular piece of content is able to deliver across a greater number of people, the greater the reward received by the creator. Steemit users can cast votes to create a hierarchy of content. The higher the upvote count received on a content piece, the more Steem is earned by its publisher. Steemit\u2019s meritocratic system also enables users that hold more currency to cast more meaningful, greater influence votes. ",

Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency. \n\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.",

Transaction speed on Verge is estimated to be at 5 seconds due to the use of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obfuscates the IP addresses of users. The introduction of the Wraith Protocol upgrade enables users to send and receive payments privately across the Verge blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services. Verge users are reportedly able to switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain. Verge offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining - Lyra2rev2, Scrypt, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl.",

A commercial content distribution (CDN) network named ZenPub uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol to offer a secure standard web architecture for publishing documents securely.
